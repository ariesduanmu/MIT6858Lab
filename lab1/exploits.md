took me long time to figure out, what I need to do is to find buffer overflow in `http.c` file...I thought I might die in `gdb -p $(pgrep zookd-exstack)`...

in `http.c` line 75
```
/* Parse request like "GET /foo.html HTTP/1.0" */
sp1 = strchr(buf, ' ');
```

so we know in line 66
```
 static char buf[8192]; 
```
this buff might be an exploit
